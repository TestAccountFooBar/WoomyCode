        <li>Added a special growth mode</li>
        <li>In this mode, you get larger and stronger forever!</li>
        <li>You also get more score from killing anything in this mode. The formula is "Math.min(x, 2_500_000) * 7 / 8", where "x" is the score the dead entity has.</li>
        <li>In this mode, bosses spawn 4x more often.</li>
        <li>Once you reach 3m score in this mode, you gain access to a special upgrade path!</li>

        <li>Made player-player collisions hard, not soft. This should make ramming more interesting.</li>

        <li>Buffed the Shield Capacity skill slightly</li>
        <li>Increased bot counts in server, but they now have the score of a lvl 45 tank, not a lvl 60 tank. They still retain a lvl 60 tank's skill point pool.</li>

        <li>Nerfed crasher damage again</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where evolved crashers/sentries had original damage, not the nerfed values</li>
        <li>Generally decreased knockback between crashers and large polygons</li>
        <li>Buffed Lancers by nerfing their damage, but buffing the range at which the lance can hit things</li>
        <li>In Boss Rush (Not Siege), the map size has been increased, and the wave difficulty has also been increased (Max 5 -> 8 Bosses/Wave). Bosses no longer go towards the nest at the start of the wave.</li>
        <li>Slightly tweaked the design of Triplet and Quintuplet</li>
